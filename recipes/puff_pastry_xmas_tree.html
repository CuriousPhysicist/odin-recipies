    <h2>Descriptoin</h2>
    <p>Puff Pastry pinwheels area a great appetizer for any occasion and during the Christmas season, I arrange them to form a spinach Chritsmas tree.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>2 red onions, chopped</li>
      <li>8 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>9 ounces fresh ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>4 multi-coloured cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat and saute the onions until soft and translucent.</li>
      <li>Add spinach, salt and pepperand briefly saute while stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cover and cook until the spinach is wilted, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove lid after 5 minutes and allow cooking liquid to evaporate. Remove from the stove and cool completely.</li>
      <li>Roll out puff pastry and evenly cover with spinach and cheese mixture to within &frac12; inch of the edges.</li>
      <li>Tightly roll the sheet lengthwise and press the edges tightly together. Wrap in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Slice pastry log into &frac34;-inch slices so you have 16 to 22 pinwheels. Lay puff pastry pinwheels in the shape of a Christmas tree. Brush with egg.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the wheels are lightly browned and puffed up, 20 to 25 minutes. Decorate with cherry tomatoes for christmas tree ornaments.</li>
