## Odin Project Fundamentals path

This is the first project in the Fundamentals path of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It is intended to bring together knowledge of the simplest parts of creating a website page.

So far the course has covered HTML elements, including appropriate use of **\<strong\>** and *\<em\>* tags for sematic accuracy.

It also covered the use of:
* Boiler-plate HTML structure
* Meta and title tags
* \<img\> and \<a\> tags with absolute and relative paths
